# Deployment Frequency

> How often a change reaches production.

## How it is measured

A deployment is a merge to `main` in a repository whose workflows publish one of this model's surfaces: the blust.ch website, which GitHub Pages publishes, and the mcp.blust.ch MCP server and the chat.blust.ch chat, which that repository's deploy and chat workflows publish. A merge counts once, however many of its workflows publish. The MCP Registry listing, republished when a release is tagged, and the LinkedIn profile, kept by hand, are not deployments.

The number of deployments in a calendar week. A workflow run that failed and published nothing is not a deployment.

## What it can hide

It rises when one change is split into several deployments and when something ships that did not need to; the first is the point and the second is noise. A rise bought with rushed changes shows in Change Fail Rate. A week without deployments reads the same whether nothing was ready or nothing was worth shipping.
