"""The facts a surface is produced from, resolved once and decided nowhere.

A surface's file says which of the model's facts reach it, in what shape and in what order.
None of that is here. What is here is the reading a machine can do the same way for any
surface — open every entity, take its frontmatter, its H1, its tagline and its sections — so
that the procedure beside this file spends its attention on the rules rather than on parsing
Markdown.

The test for anything added below: could two surfaces of the same model reasonably want it
different? If yes it belongs in the surface's file, and putting it here would make the file's
rule the second copy — the one nobody reads.
