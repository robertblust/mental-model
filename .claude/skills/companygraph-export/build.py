"""Render a CompanyGraph instance into both of its export artifacts, from one walk of the model.

`dist/<instance>-skill.zip` is uploadable as an organization or personal skill: `SKILL.md` at
the root, `model/<type>.md` per root type folder, `model/meta.md`. `dist/<instance>-notebooklm/`
is a flat folder of Markdown sources, one per content area, because NotebookLM takes files and
no archive among them. Both carry the model's own pages verbatim: an entity keeps the
frontmatter, the H1 and the body it has on disk, so nothing a reader could be answered from is
rewritten on the way out.

One program writes both because two implementations of the same intent diverge and neither one
knows it: the rule that a folder's `README.md` is never an entity reached this rendering and
the verifier while the other half of the export, a procedure followed by hand, kept the old
asymmetric count for two more commits. A hand-followed procedure is also a different program
each time somebody follows it, which is the other half of the same failure — the artifact
nobody can reproduce is the artifact nobody can tell has gone stale.

So the zip is written here rather than shelled out to `zip -r`, which embeds the current mtime
in every member and gives back an archive that differs from the last one whatever the model
did. Every member is added in sorted order with the same fixed `date_time`, `compress_type` and
`external_attr`, and nothing is staged on disk: two runs over an unchanged model produce two
byte-identical zips, so a difference between them is a difference in the model.

Run it from the instance root, or pass the root as the first argument.

Stdlib only. No third-party module is installed where this runs.

    build gives back an archive that differs from the last one in every member while the model
    did not move at all, and nothing can then tell a real change from a rebuild. So every member
    takes the same fixed timestamp, mode and compression, and they are added in sorted order —
    the three things besides the bytes themselves that a zip records. No directory entries: the
    paths carry the folders, and a directory entry is one more thing with a timestamp on it.
