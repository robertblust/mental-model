# companygraph-export

Two artifacts from one walk of the model, because the two readers want the same facts in
different shapes. `dist/mental-model-skill.zip` is uploadable as an organization or personal
skill: `SKILL.md` at the root, `model/<type>.md` per root type folder, `model/meta.md`.
`dist/mental-model-notebooklm/` is a flat folder of Markdown sources, one per content area,
carrying the model's own pages as they are written.

## Procedure

1. Run `python3 .claude/skills/companygraph-export/build.py` from the instance root. It walks
   the model once and writes both artifacts.
2. Verify: `python3 .claude/skills/companygraph-export/verify.py` exits 0.
3. `dist/` is gitignored; neither artifact is ever committed.

## Why one program and not a procedure

One intent implemented twice drifts apart one rule at a time: a rule lands in one copy and not
the other, and nothing says so.

**A procedure followed by hand is a different program each time somebody follows it.** That is
the same failure seen from the other side: the failure the second artifact exists to catch is a
bundle that went quietly stale, and a rendering nobody can re-run cheaply is a rendering that
will be stale again. So the walk, the grouping and both renderings are one script, and what it
does is written below so a reader can hold it to this rather than reproduce it.

The script writes the zip with `zipfile` rather than shelling out to `zip -r`, which records
each member's mtime and so gives back an archive that differs from the last one in every member
while the model did not move at all. Members go in in sorted order, each with the same fixed
`date_time`, `compress_type` and `external_attr`, and nothing is staged on disk. Two runs over
an unchanged model produce two byte-identical zips, so a difference between two zips is a
difference in the model.

## What the script writes into the zip

The instance name is the repository folder's name (`mental-model`); the core version comes from
`.companygraph/manifest.json`; the description comes from the root `README.md`'s opening `>`
block, joined into the one sentence it wraps across. The members are `<instance>/SKILL.md` and
`<instance>/model/`.

One `model/<folder>.md` per type folder under `model/`, with `model/profiles/` walked
recursively so experiences travel with their profile: the folder's `README.md` first, then every
entity in path order, each preceded by a line `<!-- entity: <path from the repository root> -->`
and a blank line.

Not a line holding `---`: every entity's frontmatter opens and closes with that same line, so a
consolidated file of sixty-nine skills holds a hundred and thirty-eight of them and nothing says
which sixty-nine are boundaries. An entity whose body carries a horizontal rule is
indistinguishable from a boundary, and no program can split the file at all. `<!--` collides
with neither YAML nor Markdown's own rule, it does not render, and the path gives back the
provenance consolidation throws away.

A README describes the repository's layout and the zip has a different one, so its references
are rewritten as it is inlined: `meta/<unit>/<type>-schema.md` becomes `model/meta.md`, a folder
the zip does not carry — `experiences/` — becomes the plain word, and a reference to anything
the zip holds no copy of is dropped rather than left dangling. The source on disk keeps the
paths that are correct where it lives; only the copy that travels is rewritten.

`model/meta.md` is `meta/core/CONVENTIONS.md`, then every `*-schema.md` in every unit under
`meta/`, each preceded by its own `<!-- entity: meta/<unit>/<file> -->` line. The singular
entities travel too: `model/identity.md` and `model/vision.md` are copied whole, one file each,
since there is nothing to consolidate — and they carry no marker, which `verify.py` already
knows, claiming a marker-less `model/*.md` member as the entity `model/<basename>`.

`<instance>/SKILL.md` carries frontmatter `name: <instance>` and a `description` built from the
README tagline with Markdown link and emphasis syntax stripped to plain text (a link becomes its
link text; bold and italic markers are dropped), written as a double-quoted YAML string with any
inner double quote escaped as `\"`; then `export/SKILL-intro.md` verbatim when it exists; then a
table of `model/` files with the entity count per type and the core version; then one paragraph
on how to read the model — each entity begins at its `<!-- entity: … -->` line, its H1 is its
name, references are by name, `model/meta.md` holds the rules.

## What the script writes into the NotebookLM bundle

A folder and not an archive, because NotebookLM accepts Word, plain text, Markdown, PDF, CSV,
PowerPoint, ePub, images, audio and URLs, and no archive among them.

One source per content area, named for the area — one per type folder under `model/`, one for
`meta/`, one for each singular entity such as `model/identity.md`. That is the cut the zip
already makes, so the two artifacts are grouped alike, and it is the cut an instance gets until
it says otherwise: a grouping keyed to anything the instance has not declared for every entity
cuts by what a pattern happens to match rather than by what the model says, which is an
editorial decision taken by a glob. A title raises the folder name's first letter and leaves the
rest as the folder spells it, because the title is what a citation carries.

An instance with a narrative to make declares its own grouping in
`export/notebooklm-sources.md`, and the mechanism stays for it: each `##` heading is a source's
title and its H1, the file name is that title lowercased with whitespace turned to dashes, so a
`##` heading cannot reintroduce a capital any more than a folder name does, the paths under it
claim entities and may glob, the paragraph under it opens the file, and an entity no heading
claims goes to a source named for the folder it sits in — `experiences` and never `profiles`,
because `model/profiles/` is the one folder the walk recurses into, so the root type there is
not the entity's type. This instance ships no declaration.

Two documents ship as sources beside the sources that carry entities:
`export/notebooklm-AGENTS.md` as the bundle's `AGENTS.md`, and the repository's own `README.md`,
both copied whole. The reading guide is what tells a reader that references between entities are
by name and what a claim rests on, and a guide that lives outside the bundle is a guide this
reader never sees. Neither is an entity, neither carries a marker, and a declared source may not
take either name.

A count a document states is generated and never typed. A document writes `{{entities}}`,
`{{sources}}`, or `{{count:<source title>}}` and `{{count:<path under the root>}}` where a
number goes, and the build substitutes what it counted on this run. A guide telling a reader 36
experiences beside a bundle holding 37 is exactly the staleness the second artifact exists to
catch, and nothing else would catch it: a document holds no marker, so the verifier has no
opinion about it. A token that resolves to nothing is left standing and fails the build before
anything is written, because `{{count:Skils}}` shipped to a reader is worse than a build that
stops.

Each source is then written as:

- `# <the source's title>`, and one sentence saying what the source holds and when to read it.
  The title is what a citation carries and keeps its spaces and its capital, `Experience kinds`;
  the file name is that title lowercased, with every run of whitespace turned to a single dash,
  `experience-kinds.md`, because a space or a capital in a file name is awkward to type, to quote
  in a shell and to read in a directory listing. A name the export invents this way is spelled
  the way the folder it came from spells it, so the file name and that folder are the same
  string. The sentence is what NotebookLM's per-source summary is built from and the first thing
  a reader of the source list sees. Where the instance declares its own grouping the sentence is
  the one the declaration wrote;
- the folder's `README.md` when there is one, less an opening H1 that only repeats the title the
  source has just written; a heading that differs is saying something and stays. It is context
  and never an entity — it says how the folder is laid out and against which schema each file is
  written — so it carries no marker and is counted by neither the build nor the verifier. Under
  `meta/` as much as under `model/`;
- then every entity the source holds, each preceded by a line
  `<!-- entity: <path from the repository root> -->` and reproduced verbatim: the frontmatter
  fence, the entity's own H1 and the body, nothing dropped, reordered, demoted or rewritten. The
  marker is the separator; nothing else goes between two entities.

Verbatim because every rewriting loses something a reader could have been answered from, and the
frontmatter loses the most. Prose made from it dropped fields on the way out, and the 45 skills
the LIKE MAGIC role names became 1,012 characters of one sentence where the file has a list a
reader can follow, entry by entry, to the skill that holds each claim. This reader handles
Markdown; it does not need the model translated for it, and the model is the thing the bundle is
for.

Entities are ordered shallowest first and then by path, so a profile leads the experiences it
owns rather than arriving 36 entities after the first of them. The zip orders a folder by path
alone, because a source is read front to back where a consolidated file is grepped.

Two sources may not share a file name: one file would overwrite the other and the entities in
the loser would leave the bundle with the run still reporting success, which is the way a bundle
goes quietly short. The build fails instead, before it writes anything, and names the file both
wanted. A declared pattern matching nothing on disk fails the same way and for the same reason:
a renamed folder would empty a source and drop it without a word, and the verifier would still
pass because it holds the bundle against the model and not against the declaration.

## Why the verifier is the assertion

The assertion that both artifacts are the model, whole, is running `verify.py`, not counting
lines. A marker count cannot tell a file that carries no marker because it is
copied whole from a file that carries no marker because an entity is missing, and it cannot tell
a real `<!-- entity: … -->` from one a reading guide uses as a prose example of itself — a naive
count of both artifacts against the repository raises exactly that false alarm on a correct
export, and a check that cries wolf on a correct export is a check the next operator learns to
skip. The verifier reads paths instead: every entity the zip and the bundle each carry, compared
against the model's own and against each other. Its final line names what it checked —
`PASS  11 sources, 133 entities, largest 15,383 words; zip agrees` when both artifacts hold,
`zip not built` in its place when only the bundle was rebuilt, and a `FAIL` line naming the path
that does not agree when one of them is wrong.

It should now never be able to find a disagreement, because one walk feeds both renderings and
there is no second traversal to fall behind. It stays because that is a claim about the code
rather than about the artifacts on disk, and the artifacts are what get uploaded: a bundle built
two days ago and five experiences short reads as correct and is not.
