# Domain Schema

> Required structure for domain files.

## File Location

`model/domains/*.md`

A domain owns nothing, so it is a file: its concepts and its products name it rather than sit inside it, because a concept one domain owned could not be named by a concept of another.

## Frontmatter

| Field | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | Yes | string | What identifies this entity for as long as it exists, in the format `model/identifier.md` declares (R18) |
| `source` | Yes | ref → source | Where this page's facts are mastered — the H1 of a file in `sources/` |
| `source-id` | No | string | The identifier this page has in its source — a directory id, a record key. Absent when the source has none, as a repository does not. |

## Sections

| Section | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `# [Domain]` | Yes | The canonical name of the domain. A concept's or a product's `domain` references this exact string. |
| `> [Scope]` | Yes | One-paragraph statement of what this domain covers and what it leaves to another |
| `## References` | No | Table. What a reader can open to learn more about the area; its columns are declared below. |

`## References` is a table with these columns:

| Column | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `What` | Yes | string | The kind of document — a charter, a map of the area |
| `URL` | Yes | string | Where it is |

## Purpose

A domain is one area of the company — the words it means something exact by there, and the products it ships there — and it answers "where does this belong, and who decides what it means?" for a reader looking a term or a product up and for a writer placing a new one. It holds no definitions and lists nothing: what a domain contains is read from the concepts and products naming it.

## Writing rules

- The scope says what the domain covers and names at least one thing it deliberately leaves to another domain, because a boundary stated from one side only is not a boundary.
- The H1 names the area, not the team that owns it or the system that implements it.
- The page carries no diagram and no list of the domain's concepts or its products. Each is a second copy of what those files already say.
