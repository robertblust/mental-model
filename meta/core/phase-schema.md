# Phase Schema

> Required structure for phase files.

**Owner:** process

## File Location

`model/processes/<process>/phases/*.md`

A phase is owned by a process and cannot exist without it, so it nests inside the process's
folder rather than sitting at the root with a `process:` field pointing back. The filename is
R12's default, the slug of the H1. It carries no position prefix: the order is the owning
process's `## Phases` table and the `gate-to` chain, and a third copy on the filename would have
to be renamed through the whole folder whenever a phase was inserted.

## Frontmatter

| Field | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `source` | Yes | ref → source | Where this page's facts are mastered — the H1 of a file in `sources/` |
| `source-id` | No | string | The identifier this page has in its source — a directory id, a record key. Absent when the source has none, as a repository does not. |
| `owner` | Yes | ref → role | The seat accountable for the phase's outcome, the H1 of a file in `roles/`. Distinct from the **Owner:** line above, which names the type that owns a phase; this field names the seat. |
| `executed-by` | Yes | array of ref → role | The seats that do the phase's work |
| `supported-by` | No | array of ref → role | The seats consulted in the phase, producing nothing it is graded on |
| `gate-approvers` | Yes | array of ref → role | The seats that approve passage out of the phase. At least one; a phase nobody approves is an activity inside another phase. |
| `escalation-authority` | Yes | ref → role | The seat that decides when the gate's criteria cannot be met |
| `gate-to` | No | ref → phase | The phase this gate leads to. Absent on the last phase, and only there. |

## Sections

| Section | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `# [Phase]` | Yes | The canonical name of the phase. The owning process's `## Phases` table and the previous phase's `gate-to` reference it by this exact string. |
| `> [Goal]` | Yes | One-paragraph statement of what the phase is for |
| `## What it takes` | Yes | What enters the phase, and what it refuses to start without |
| `## Activities` | Yes | Grouped. A numbered list of what is done; where the work differs by track, one `### [Track]` heading per track, each with its own numbered list |
| `## What it produces` | Yes | Table. What leaves the phase; its columns are declared below. |
| `## What it never does` | Yes | A list, one sentence each, of what the phase refuses |
| `## Gate` | Yes | The criteria that must be satisfied to leave the phase, as a list, and what happens when they cannot be |

`## Activities` is grouped under these headings:

| Heading | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Track` | No | ref → track | The track the numbered list below it is the work of, by its canonical name: the H1 of a file in the owning process's `tracks/` |

`## What it produces` is a table with these columns:

| Column | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Deliverable` | Yes | string | The thing that leaves the phase |
| `Description` | Yes | string | What it is, and what makes it finished |

## Purpose

A phase is one step of a process and the gate at its end — what enters, what is done, what
leaves, and what must be true for it to leave. It answers "am I done, and who says so?" for
whoever is in it. The gate is the part the model enforces: the document a phase produces scales
with the size of the change and may be a conversation rather than a file, and the approval at
its end does not scale at all.

## Writing rules

- A gate criterion is a sentence that can fail: "the checks pass on the branch" can, "quality
  is good" cannot.
- A phase whose activities are the same for every track carries no track headings at all, and
  one that carries any puts every activity under one: an activity above the first heading
  belongs to no track, and the instance checks say so.
- Activities are a numbered list, because their order is the order the work is done in, and the
  instance checks read the marker. A numbered list under no track heading is a phase whose work
  is the same on every track. Bullets under no heading are reported as standing under no track,
  as an entry's achievements under no kind are, and the answer is to number them and not to add
  a heading.
- `gate-to` names the next phase and the owning process's `## Phases` table says the same thing;
  where the two disagree the model is wrong, not the reader, and the instance checks say so.
- The last phase has no `gate-to`, and its gate is the one that releases the work.
- A phase's name is unique within its process (R2): two processes may each call a phase
  `Review`, and a `gate-to` or a process's `## Phases` finds the one in its own process (R4). A
  phase and a role may share a name, since a reference carries the type it resolves under.
- `executed-by` names the seats that do the work, never the seat that approves it; a seat that
  only signs belongs in `gate-approvers`.
